                <p>Steve Jobs was a pioneer who cared deeply about design. He believed that products should be both beautiful and easy to use. For Jobs, good design wasn't just about how something looked, but how it worked.</p>
                <p>He pushed for simplicity, arguing that less is often more. Jobs wanted devices that were clean, elegant, and intuitive. He paid attention to every detail, even parts users couldn't see.</p>
                <p>Jobs thought design should solve problems and make life better. He aimed to create products that people would love and find joy in using. His vision led to iconic designs like the iMac, iPod, and iPhone.</p>
                <p>He often said, "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." This idea guided Apple to make products that changed how we interact with technology.</p>
                <p>Jobs' focus on design helped make Apple a leader in creating devices that are both functional and beautiful.</p>

                <p id="quote">"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works. It's not just about aesthetics. Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit our needs so well that the design is invisible." - Steve Jobs</p>
